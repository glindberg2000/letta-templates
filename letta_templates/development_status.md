# NPC System Development Status (January 2025)

## Letta Integration (Updated)

### Agent System
1. **Core Integration**
   - Letta 0.6.6 server integration
   - Enhanced memory blocks:
     * persona (NPC identity and journal)
     * group_members (social tracking)
     * locations (navigation data)
     * status (current state)
   - Expanded tool registry
   - Multi-user conversation support
   - Advanced system prompt integration

2. **Memory System**
   ```python
   # Complete Memory Block Structure
   memory = BasicBlockMemory(
       blocks=[
           # Persona Block - NPC's identity, personality, and journal
           client.create_block(
               label="persona",
               value=json.dumps({
                   "name": "emma_assistant",

                   "last_updated": "2024-01-06T22:35:00Z"
               }),
               limit=2000
           ),
           
           # Locations Block - Navigation and spatial data
           client.create_block(
               label="locations",
               value=json.dumps({
                   "known_locations": [

                           "coordinates": [-12.0, 18.9, -127.0],
                           "slug": "petes_stand"
                       },
                       {
                           "name": "Secret Garden",
                           "description": "A hidden garden with rare flowers",
                           "coordinates": [15.5, 20.0, -110.8],
                           "slug": "secret_garden"

3. **Tool System**
   ```python
   # Available tools with enhanced functionality
   TOOL_REGISTRY = {
       # Navigation Tools
       "navigate_to": navigate_to,  # Slug-based navigation
       "navigate_to_coordinates": navigate_to_coordinates,  # Direct coordinate movement
       
       # Action Tools
       "perform_action": perform_action,  # Emotes and interactions
       "examine_object": examine_object,  # Object inspection
       
       # Memory Tools
       "group_memory_append": group_memory_append,    # Add group updates
