# Active Development Context

## Current Focus
- Improving NPC status system with more immersive first-person descriptions
- Enhanced health status awareness
- More realistic injury/condition responses

## Recent Changes
1. Status System Updates:
   - Added first-person descriptive status
   - Improved health status handling
   - More realistic injury scenarios
   - Better status awareness in responses

2. Prompt Improvements:
   - Added health awareness guidelines
   - Added realistic injury examples
   - Enhanced status checking instructions

## Next Steps
1. Update documentation for new status features
2. Create Roblox developer guide
3. Test health status responses
4. Document new status format

## Current Issues
- Need to ensure consistent health status responses
- Documentation needs updating
- Need to create Roblox integration guide

### Changes Made
1. Fixed `group_memory_replace` to correctly update notes:
```python
# Update notes only
current_notes = block["players"][player_id].get("notes", "")
block["players"][player_id]["notes"] = current_notes.replace(old_note, new_note)
```

2. Verified separation of concerns:
- Agent tools (`group_memory_append/replace`): Only modify notes
- API function (`upsert_group_member`): Full access to update any field

### Testing Status
âœ… Notes functionality test passed:
- âœ… Append: Correctly adds new notes
- âœ… Replace: Only updates notes field, preserves other fields
- âœ… Memory: Agent accurately recalls notes
- âœ… Fields: Appearance and notes properly separated
- âœ… Timestamps: Last seen updated correctly

ðŸ”„ Still need to test:
1. Status updates
2. Social awareness
3. Navigation
4. Action emotes

### Notes
- Agent tools working as designed - strict field access
- API functions maintain full update capability
- Need to verify other test failures are not related to memory changes
