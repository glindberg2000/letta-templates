# Product Context

## Core Purpose
- NPC behavior system for game world interactions
- Enables natural, contextual NPC responses
- Supports multiple NPC roles (waiter, merchant, etc.)

## Key Problems Solved
- Simplified action system for NPCs
- Clear separation between navigation and actions
- Consistent behavior patterns for different roles
- Emergency response capabilities

## Expected Behavior
- NPCs should use appropriate actions for their role
- Navigation uses style options for different movement types
- Emergency actions (hide/flee) require specific targets
- Social actions (emote/follow) maintain interaction flow

## Why This Project Exists
Letta Templates is a Python framework created to solve the challenge of building intelligent, socially-aware NPCs (Non-Player Characters) in interactive environments. It provides a structured way to manage NPC memory, status, and group interactions.

## How It Should Work
The system should:
1. Maintain consistent NPC memory and state
2. Handle social interactions naturally
3. Process and respond to events appropriately
4. Track group dynamics and location changes
5. Provide tools for managing NPC behavior
