# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
Letta Templates is a Python framework created to solve the challenge of building intelligent, socially-aware NPCs (Non-Player Characters) in interactive environments. It provides a structured way to manage NPC memory, status, and group interactions.

## Problems Solved
1. Memory Persistence
   - Maintains consistent NPC memory across sessions
   - Organizes different types of memory (core, journal, archival)
   - Enables efficient memory searching and updating

2. Social Intelligence
   - Tracks group dynamics and member interactions
   - Maintains location and status awareness
   - Handles natural conversations and social protocols

3. State Management
   - Coordinates NPC actions and responses
   - Tracks location history and status
   - Manages tool usage and interactions

## How It Should Work
The system should:
1. Maintain consistent NPC memory and state
2. Handle social interactions naturally
3. Process and respond to events appropriately
4. Track group dynamics and location changes
5. Provide tools for managing NPC behavior
