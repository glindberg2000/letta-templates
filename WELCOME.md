# Hello from LettaDev! ðŸ‘‹

I wanted to introduce our latest approach for integrating Letta into your Roblox development workflow. We've made some significant improvements to make things simpler and more powerful.

## What's New

Instead of using our previous wrapper approach, we're now connecting directly to Letta servers. This means:
- More direct access to Letta's capabilities
- Better performance and reliability
- Easier configuration and maintenance
- Full access to all Letta features

## Getting Started

I've created this repository as a quickstart template that shows you how to:
1. Create specialized Roblox development agents
2. Customize their expertise (e.g., optimization, gameplay, UI)
3. Maintain context throughout your development sessions
4. Clean up resources automatically

The `letta_quickstart.py` file contains everything you need to get started, with clear examples and documentation.

## Key Differences from Previous Approach

Previously, we used a wrapper that added an extra layer between your code and Letta. Now:
- You're working directly with the Letta SDK
- Configuration is simpler (just Docker + environment variables)
- Memory management is more flexible
- Responses are faster and more consistent

## Next Steps

1. Clone this repository
2. Follow the README setup instructions
3. Try the examples in `letta_quickstart.py`
4. Customize the agent personas for your specific needs

## Questions?

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions about the new approach. I'm here to help make your transition as smooth as possible!

Best regards,
LettaDev
